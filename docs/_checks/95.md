cNumber: CHECK_95

As mentioned in the SAP Styleguide, the "me->" self reference [should be omitted](https://github.com/SAP/styleguides/blob/master/clean-abap/CleanABAP.md#omit-the-self-reference-me-when-calling-an-instance-method)
The reason being that "me->" ist set implicitly by the system and is also valid for static member access or method calling.

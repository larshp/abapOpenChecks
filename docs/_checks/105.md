SAP provides a feature called the RFC blocklist, which prevents specific function modules from being called remotely via RFC. 
This mechanism is used to block function modules that have undergone incompatible signature changes in S/4HANA. 
For more details, refer to SAP Note 2259818.

You can use this check to find function modules that are called via RFC but are on the system's RFC blocklist.
This check only makes sense to use if the target system also uses the same RFC blocklist as the source system.

If you want to use this check via RFC, then abapOpenChecks must be cloned to the target system.

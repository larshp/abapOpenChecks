### CHECK
See [https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_750_index_htm/7.50/en-US/abapcheck_processing_blocks.htm](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_750_index_htm/7.50/en-US/abapcheck_processing_blocks.htm)


> #### **Rule** ([see](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_750_index_htm/7.50/en-US/abenexit_procedure_guidl.htm#@@ITOC@@ABENEXIT_PROCEDURE_GUIDL_2))
> Only use RETURN to exit procedures
>
> ##### **Exception**
> An exception to the rule to only use RETURN to exit procedures are CHECK statements that are located at the beginning of a procedure and that check the prerequisites for the execution of the procedure there. Using the CHECK statement in such a way does not impair the legibility and is thus allowed. However, this exception does not apply to other positions within a procedure and outside loops.

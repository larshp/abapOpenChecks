title: Local existence of function modules called via RFC
cNumber: CHECK_104
rfc: false

When a function module is called remotely via RFC, then the function module doesn't necessarily have to exist locally. It can be beneficial to create the function modules nonetheless, especially to perform checks on the parameter types. 

You can use this check to find function modules that are called via RFC but that don't exist locally or are not RFC-enabled.

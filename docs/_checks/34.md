Large number of lines within WHEN construct, refactor code

```abap
CASE lv_foo.
  WHEN 'BAAR'
    ...
    code
    ...
ENDCASE.
```

can be transformed to the following, it will become easier to get an overview of the CASE

```abap
CASE lv_foo.
  WHEN 'BAAR'
    PERFORM foobar.
ENDCASE.

FORM foobar.
  ...
  code
  ...
ENDFORM.
```

title: Unit test not covering class
cNumber: CHECK_64
rfc: false
---

If copying a class along with unit tests, and not adjusting the unit tests, the unit tests still test the old class.

This check will run the coverage analyzer to make sure the unit test covers the class.

Note: This check does not work very well in parallel, as coverage analysis requires global lock

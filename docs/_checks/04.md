The number of lines shown in a short dump or the debugger is limited. Traditionally code length is kept to around 80 characters.
In short dumps only 72(?) characters are shown, and when using the 2 column code comparison tool only a limited number of characters is shown.

Keeping this in mind, the offical SAP styleguide recommends a maximum line length of 120 characters.

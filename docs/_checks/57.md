## MESSAGE in global classes

Use message based class exceptions for error handling.

In some cases it is necessary to use MESSAGE in a global class in order to write to the job log for a program 
which is run as a background job. An example is when implementing a standard BAdI which doesn't have any exception
handling. This can be solved by breaking out the MESSAGE part of the code into a separate function module, and
call this function module from the class.

## WRITE in global classes

Refactor solution so classes are not responsible for GUI output
